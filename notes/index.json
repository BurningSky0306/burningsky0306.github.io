It introduces the one-variable linear regression framework, emphasizing its construction via least squares optimization to minimize prediction errors (\\(SS_{\\text{residual}} = \\sum{(\\hat{y}-y)^2}\\)). The analysis highlights significance testing (t-tests for slope parameters, F-tests for model comparisons) and critical metrics like \\(R^2\\) and adjusted mean squared error (\\(MS_{\\text{error}}\\)) that balance prediction accuracy against model complexity. A key focus is hierarchical regression, demonstrating how covariate-controlled models enhance robustness in identifying meaningful predictors. The discussion further underscores the value of multi-dimensional operational definitions (e.g., physiological/behavioral metrics) for reinforcing result reliability. Practical guidelines for interpreting degrees of freedom, model comparisons, and error decomposition provide actionable insights for empirical research design.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["Regression Analysis"],"title":"How to Build and Compare Statistical Models Through Regression Analysis and Significance Testing"}]
